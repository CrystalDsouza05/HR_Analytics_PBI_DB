## ðŸ“Œ About this Dashboard
Recreated a dynamic HR dashboard originally built in Excel using Power BI, inspired by a "Green Goblin" theme. The project emphasized both design consistency and technical accuracy, covering key metrics such as employee count, gender distribution, age analysis, employment status, regional distribution, salary trends, and training insights. This hands-on challenge enhanced my skills in KPI creation, Power BI visualization, and dashboard storytelling. Special thanks to Nnajekwu Victory for the dataset and inspiration!
